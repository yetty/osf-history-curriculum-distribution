\begin{abstract}
Analysing Czech school curricula is challenging due to their inconsistent structure, layout, and terminology. This study explores the potential of AI to address these challenges, using History content as a case study. We evaluated AI's ability to (a) extract relevant data from curricula, (b) categorise historical content into coherent topics, and (c) assign appropriate historical era labels to each topic.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context and Background}

todo: link osf project https://osf.io/53k9b/

%% Introduce current situation in the Czech Republic with ongoing revision of national curriculum for primary schools. Provide a bit more context about the revision process. For example, explain why the curriculum is being revised (e.g., new educational goals, alignment with modern teaching standards). Mention the timeframe or scope of the revision (if relevant). %%

last version of Czech National Curriculum for elementary and lower-secondary education: \cite{RVPZV2023}

%% Briefly introduce Czech history school curricula and the challenges in analyzing their diversity. Introduce the diversity of Czech history curricula in more detail. Briefly highlight key differences (e.g., variations in format, topics, or thematic depth). Provide a brief example of these differences to ground your readers in the problem. %%


\cite{Gracova2015Problems} outline the main focus of the Czech National Curricula, which were ratified in 2004 and implemented in 2005. First, the development of the new curricula was driven by political motivations, particularly the need to overcome the lingering influence of communism on the educational system and to cultivate democratically minded citizens. Second, there were educational imperatives associated with a shift towards constructivist approaches in education and the introduction of a skills-based curriculum. The latter defines both \textit{key competences}, which encompass broader transferable skills, and subject-specific competences aimed at developing expertise in individual disciplines.

However, as \cite{Jirecek2023Promeny} states, teachers adopted the new curricula reluctantly, primarily due to a lack of methodological support. As a result, Czech schools did not transform their approaches to the extent envisioned by the curriculum's authors. Although each school was required to develop its own school curriculum based on the national framework, many simply transferred the old content into the new format and accompanying documents.

\subsection{Objective}

%% State the primary aim of the paper: quantitatively evaluating AI’s performance in topic splitting and labeling compared to human researchers. %%

Given the complexity of Czech school curricula and the lack of systematic post-implementation analysis tools, this study aims to...

%% Briefly mention why comparing AI performance quantitatively (rather than qualitatively) is a critical contribution, e.g., scalability, replicability, or objectivity. %% 

\subsection{Scope}

%% Outline the focus on evaluating GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for topic splitting and labeling. Briefly note (without diving into detail) that the focus is limited to history curricula and specific AI tasks (splitting and labeling). %%

%% Emphasize the importance of creating a reliable method for comparing diverse school curricula. %%

%% Mention problem of missing analysis - nobody will be able to assess differences after implementing the new curriculum (even if the goal is to lower amount of topics and go deeper.) %%

%% Highlight the potential of AI in automating curriculum analysis and the research gap this study addresses. Explain why the lack of analysis is a significant issue. Elaborate on the potential consequences, e.g., how the absence of systematic comparisons could hinder policymakers or educators in evaluating the revision's success. Highlight why this makes the automation of analysis an appealing solution. %%

\cite{Jirecek2023Tricet, Jirecek2023Promeny} analysed the position of history education within the school curricula of general secondary schools (ISCED 2) following minor changes to the national curriculum. He examined 200 school curricula that were publicly accessible online through school websites. His research questions focused on: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item how frequently history content is integrated with other subjects or as part of an integrated social sciences subject;
	\item the number of hours per week allocated to history lessons in schools;
	\item the extent to which schools prioritise modern history within their curricula.
\end{enumerate}

His findings provide valuable insights into the updated allocation of history lessons and reveal a significant overloading of the final grade with extensive content related to modern history. However, his findings are limited to schools with publicly accessible curricula. In our findings, we show that many schools are unwilling to share their curricula, and selecting only an easily accessible population of curricula may lead to biased input data. Schools that share their curricula tend to be more modern and open-minded in their approach, whereas those unwilling to do so are often more rigorous and conservative. This discrepancy may distort interpretations of curriculum implementation and innovation.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset Description}

The data used in this study were collected as part of our research on the distribution of history content within Czech school curricula at the lower secondary level. To achieve this, we aimed to gather curricula from a representative sample of all Czech schools that met the following criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The school is listed in the Czech Ministry of Education School Register and, as such, is required to follow the national curricula. This requirement applies universally to all types of schools in the Czech educational system, including public, private, and religious schools.
    \item The school is fully organized and includes all grades of ISCED 2.
    \item The school had a non-zero number of students enrolled during the most recent academic year.
    \item The school qualifies as a \textit{standard} institution according to the Czech educational system (i.e., the school type in the M3 report is \textsc{B10}).
\end{enumerate}


Data on schools were obtained from the spring 2024 edition of the M3 report, which is published biannually (once in spring and once in autumn) by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. Based on these criteria, the final population consisted of 2,486 schools.

From this population, we constructed a proportional stratified sample based on the number of students enrolled at each school. To define the strata, we applied Jenks Natural Breaks, a method designed to minimise variance within strata while maximising variance between strata (see Figure \ref{school-distribution-plot}). This stratification resulted in three distinct groups, reflecting differences in school sizes. The required sample size for each stratum was calculated using Cochran’s equation, which ensures that population parameters can be estimated with a specified level of precision, confidence, and variability. This systematic approach allowed us to create a representative sample while accounting for the varying sizes of schools in the population.


\begin{figure} \centering \resizebox*{10cm}{!}{\includegraphics{student_distribution_plot.eps}} \caption{Distribution of student enrolment across schools in the study population, with strata boundaries determined using Jenks Natural Breaks.} \label{school-distribution-plot} \end{figure}


To maintain reproducibility, we employed an R script with a fixed random seed to select the schools included in the sample. Details of the strata distribution, including the number of schools and sample sizes, are presented in Table \ref{strata-distribution}.

\begin{table}
\tbl{Distribution of schools across strata by number of students}
{\begin{tabular}{lccc} \toprule
Stratum & Number of schools & Sample size & Median students \\ \midrule
1 (small schools) & $1,182$ & $158$ & $164.00$ \\
2 (medium schools) & $864$ & $116$ & $400.50$ \\
3 (large schools) & $440$ & $59$ & $641.00$ \\ \midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{$2,486$} & \textbf{$333$} & \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\label{strata-distribution}
\end{table}

In the following steps, we aimed to obtain the curricula from all schools in the sample, or at least the section related to the content of History. According to Czech law, school curricula must be publicly accessible; however, the law does not specify the manner in which they should be made accessible. Initially, we attempted to locate the curricula on the schools’ websites. Next, we contacted the schools via email, requesting either their full curriculum or the relevant sections. Finally, we submitted an official request under Czech Act No. 106/1999 Coll. on Free Access to Information. Based on this law, publicly funded schools are required to provide remote access to their curricula. However, this obligation does not apply to private or religious schools.

From July to November 2024, we successfully obtained 321 curricula. Two schools declined our request (the Law on Free Access to Information did not apply due to their status as non-public schools), and ten schools did not respond to our official request. For details regarding the sources from which the school curricula were obtained, see Table \ref{curricula-sources}. With combination of all collection methods, we were able to achieve a very high response rate for the returned curricula.

\begin{table}
\tbl{Sources of school curricula}
{\begin{tabular}{lcc} \toprule
Source & Count & Percentage \\ \midrule
Website & $198$ & $59.46\%$ \\
Mail Request & $43$ & $12.91\%$ \\
Official Request & $80$ & 24.02\% \\ \midrule
\textbf{Returned Curricula} & $321$ & $96.40\%$ \\ \midrule
Refused & $2$ & $0.60\%$ \\ 
No Response & $10$ & $3.00\%$ \\ \midrule
\textbf{Total} & $333$ & $100.00\%$ \\ \midrule
\end{tabular}}
\label{curricula-sources}
\end{table}

Schools provide curricula in various formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX, DOC, XLSX), often separated by subjects or grades across multiple files. To standardize the input data, we converted all curricula into PDF format, combining multiple files when necessary.


\subsection{Human and AI Coding Processes}

The goal of this study was twofold: (1) to validate AI as a viable alternative to human coders for analyzing school curricula, and (2) to identify its limitations and highlight specific contexts in which AI can be effectively applied. To achieve this, we evaluated AI performance on three tasks:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item extracting relevant history content from school curricula PDFs,  
    \item splitting extracted content into discrete topics, and  
    \item labeling topics into broader historical themes aligned with the Czech National Curriculum.  
\end{enumerate}

We compared AI outputs with those produced by a human coder, who served as the benchmark. The human coder was an experienced lower-secondary history teacher familiar with Czech school curricula structure, terminology, and content.

For AI processing, we utilized two versions of GPT-4: \texttt{gpt-4o-2024-08-06} and \texttt{gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18}. These models were selected due to GPT-4's widespread popularity and accessibility. The \texttt{gpt-4o-mini} version offered faster processing and lower costs but operated with a smaller contextual window compared to the full version. This tradeoff is discussed further in the results section.

We evaluated AI performance based on the following criteria:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy}: How closely AI outputs aligned with human-coded results.  
    \item \textbf{Processing time}: Measured as the total runtime of the AI processing scripts.  
    \item \textbf{Cost}: Derived directly from OpenAI’s administrative console based on token usage.  
\end{enumerate}

The following subsections describe each of the three tasks in detail, including the methods applied and the criteria for evaluation.

\subsubsection{Data Extraction}

Due to the absence of a unified format for Czech school curricula, we encountered significant variability in document styles, file sizes, content organization, and terminology. The primary objectives of this task were twofold:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To identify the section of the curriculum dedicated to the \textit{History} subject, and  
    \item To extract the relevant content for each grade level.  
\end{enumerate}

Both the AI models and the human coder were tasked with examining each document, locating the \textit{History} section, and systematically extracting and categorizing all relevant content by grade. These extracted content chunks were later used in subsequent processes, such as topic splitting and labeling.

This step was anticipated to be the most challenging in the data extraction process. Many curricula lacked a table of contents, making it difficult to efficiently locate the relevant \textit{History} section. Furthermore, the organization and presentation of history content varied significantly between schools. Examples of this variability included:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Curricula presenting the expected learning outcomes and content in a structured table format,  
    \item Curricula combining outcomes and content into a single table cell, and  
    \item Curricula providing content as narrative paragraphs beneath tables listing expected outcomes.  
\end{itemize}

These structural differences posed challenges for both the AI models and the human coder, as they had to locate, interpret, and extract consistent information across diverse document formats.  

To evaluate the quality of the extracted chunks, we planned to compare the outputs of the AI models and the human coder using two key metrics:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total count of extracted chunks}: This metric assesses whether the AI and human coders extracted a similar number of meaningful units.
    \item \textbf{Character length of extracted chunks}: To evaluate the granularity of extractions, we measured the average and total character lengths of the chunks.
\end{itemize}

To conduct this comparison, a random sample of extracted chunks was selected for detailed analysis. This sampling ensured a fair and representative evaluation of the AI and human performance in this step of the process.

However, during initial trials of AI processing the school curricula, we identified significant limitations that rendered AI unsuitable for this task without extensive customization. These limitations included:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High costs}: Processing the large PDF files using AI proved financially prohibitive. On average, the school curricula PDFs were $252.23$ pages long (see Figure \ref{figure:pages-distribution-plot} for pages distribution), with an average file size of $2.97$ MB.  
    \item \textbf{Low extraction accuracy}: AI frequently failed to correctly extract the \textit{History} section of the files. This issue was compounded by the inconsistent organization of the curricula and the lack of a uniform structure across documents.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure} \centering \resizebox*{12cm}{!}{\includegraphics{curricula_pages_distribution_plot.eps}} \caption{Distribution of number of pages of complete school curricula (already extracted History parts have been excluded).} \label{figure:pages-distribution-plot} \end{figure}


Addressing these challenges would require advanced preprocessing, fine-tuning of the AI models, the use of vector stores, and the development of extensive custom scripts. As a result, we were unable to compare extracted content chunks between AI and human coders. For the subsequent stages of the project, only the chunks provided by the human coder were used.

\subsubsection{Topic Splitting}

In order to facilitate a meaningful comparison of school curricula, we needed a robust method for identifying and distinguishing individual content topics. Typically, these topics are presented on separate lines in curricula; however, some schools did not clearly separate them, and topics were sometimes embedded within broader sections. Additionally, the definition of what constitutes a single topic varies across curricula, with some topics being more generalized, while others are more specific.

To address this, we split the content into meaningful units. The human coder was used as the baseline for this task, with instructions to follow traditional topic divisions found in Czech history textbooks when determining what constitutes a single topic unit.

For AI processing, we used a single-shot strategy (TODO: add source on AI prompting strategy) and provided the following prompt in Czech. The English translation is provided here. See the referenced repository (TODO link to repository) for original prompts:

\begin{quotation}
    The user will provide history curriculum content for a primary school, which may contain inconsistent formatting, transcription errors, and other issues. Reformat the content so that each line corresponds to a distinct and meaningful unit, aligned with the curriculum.
\end{quotation}


We let the AI process all school curricula, but because this task would be very time-consuming for the human coder, we decided on a smaller sample, even at the cost of a lower confidence level. We used stratified sampling with grades as individual strata and randomly chose 25 content chunks for each grade, resulting in a total sample of 100 content chunks. With 2,186 extracted chunks from previous steps, using a sample size of 100 chunks provides sufficient confidence for this type of analysis, ensuring representativeness and reliability.

We compared the performance of the AI models against the human coder’s baseline using F1-score, which measures both precision and recall to evaluate how well the models split topics.


\subsubsection{Topic Labeling}

To evaluate the AI’s ability to label topics, we used predefined labels (referred to as "codes") based on the Czech National Curriculum. Each distinct topic from the school curricula was matched with two labels: one broader history theme label (e.g., '\textit{Earliest Civilizations. Roots of European Culture}') and one more specific topic label (e.g., '\textit{The Oldest Ancient Civilizations...}' or '\textit{Ancient Greece and Rome}'). A complete list of these codes can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:national-curriculum-topics}. If no predefined label was applicable, the label \textit{other} was used.

Both the human coder and the AI models had access to this coding table. For the AI, we converted the table into a markdown list format to facilitate processing. Both human coder and the AI models used the content chunks generated by the GPT-4 model in the previous step as input for labeling.

The AI was tasked with labeling the entire set of content topics. For human labeling, we used a clustered sampling approach to balance representativeness (ensuring a variety of topics) with the goal of minimizing the amount of human processing required. To do this, we first represented each topic as a vector using OpenAI’s \texttt{text-embedding-3-large} model. We then applied a K-means clustering algorithm to group similar topics together. From each cluster, we randomly selected one topic for human labeling. 

% TODO: Elaborate on the clustering process. Specifically, we plan to explore how we determined the number of clusters and whether any dimensionality reduction methods were used prior to clustering. 

The human coder did not have access to the AI's labeling results to ensure the evaluation was unbiased. To assess the agreement between the human and AI labels, we computed Cohen’s Kappa, a statistical measure of inter-rater reliability. Cohen’s Kappa quantifies the level of agreement between two raters (in this case, the human coder and the AI models) while accounting for the possibility of agreement occurring by chance. A higher Kappa value indicates stronger agreement. This measure was applied to evaluate both the broader theme and specific topic labels, helping us assess the consistency of the AI models with the human coder’s labeling.
